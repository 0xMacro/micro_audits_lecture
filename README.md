# Micro Audits Lecture

Simple Repo to store bad and great examples of peer micro audits for our W1D5 Micro Audits Intro Lecture

## Audits

### Bad Audit

This audit is bad because:

- not enough details about issue
- doesn't suggest fixes
- no references to code or spec
- CQ issue is 100% personal preference

### Great Audit

This audit is great because:

- more details
- more references to spec and to lines of code
- suggests fixes
- mentions uncertainty about severity where appropriate
